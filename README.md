<!-- ## Cors

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

* A web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different domain (i.e. different ports)
* Web application using APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was loaded from, unless the response from the other origin includes the right CORS headers.
